If its not working properly as expected, follow:
Disable firewall, defender and temporarily remove antivirus if any. 
Why? The files are stored on your pc. It acts as a server and all the devices on the network are supposed to access and change the files as well. This is usually not allowed by firewall, windows defender or antivirus installed. Hence its better to temporarily disable them when this system is running.
